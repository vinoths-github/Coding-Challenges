# Coding Challenges

Task 1 :
 Both Bilinear Interpolation and Linear Interpolations were used. When the former fails, the latter will be used to calculate the interpolation.
Bilinear Interpolation was calculated based on the formula from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation
Linear Interpolation is based on the formula, (y-y1)/(x-x1) = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) 
 
 
 Task2 :
  The nodes at the same level are Ordered(Ascending Order) every time after when the Parent node is created.
 Usage of Collections:                                                                 
 HashMap : for the Leaf nodes with Key as Word and Occurrence count as Value.
 PriorityQueue : to order the nodes at same level.
 B-Tree : Mentioned 3 Types fo Traversal to print all the nodes.
